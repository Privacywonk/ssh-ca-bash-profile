# Vault SSH CA .bash_profile helper function(s)
Expansion of the function provided by @Kawsark https://gist.github.com/kawsark/587f40541881cea58fbaaf07bb82b1be

quick hack together for a project I am doing with Hashicorp Vault SSH CA signed certificates. 

Drop this into your .bash_profile, adjust variables for the Vault server, timeout policy, etc. Assumes username/password auth.
